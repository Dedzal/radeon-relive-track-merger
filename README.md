# Relive Track Merger

The `Relive Track Merger` is a tool designed to **embed microphone tracks into Radeon Relive replays**.
By automating this process, it eliminates the hassle of managing separate media files during video editing,
saving time and effort â€” especially when handling large collections of replays.
The application uses `FFmpeg` as a CLI tool to add the microphone track to the replay.

The tool offers two ways of processing: 

1. **Copying files to a separate output folder** (`replays_merged`), preserving the original replays
2. **Replacing the original files** directly in their current location

Even if disk space is an issue, copying files to the `replays_merged` folder is highly recommended to
ensure the original replays remain intact and are not replaced by potentially corrupt files.

## Prerequisites

- **Java**:  
  Required to launch the .jar file. You can download Java [here](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp). <br>
  To check if Java is installed, open cmd and run:
    ```bash
      java -version
    ```

- **FFmpeg**:  
  FFmpeg handles the core task of adding the microphone track to the replay. If not installed, the app can automatically install it using
  the [Windows Package Manager (winget)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget).
  Alternatively, you can manually install FFmpeg from its [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). <br>
  To verify ffmpeg is installed, run:
    ```bash
      ffmpeg -version
    ```
## How It Works

1. **Select Input Folder** <br>
   Choose the directory where your replays are stored. You can select a specific game folder (e.g.,
   `Radeon Relive\ArmA 3`) or the entire `Radeon Relive` directory to process all replays.

2. **Select Output Folder** <br>
   Define where the processed files will be saved. By default, the output directory is set to
   `INPUT_FOLDER\replays_merged`, and the directory structure is preserved.
   If you prefer to overwrite the original files, the output folder option will be disabled.

3. **Process Files** <br>
   Click the `Process` button to start merging microphone tracks into corresponding replays. Files without a matching
   microphone track will either be copied or left untouched based on your settings.

**File Identification**:

- **Replays**: `.mp4` files with `_replay_` in their filename.
- **Microphone Tracks**: `.m4a` files with the same name as their corresponding replay, located in the same directory.
- **Already Processed Files**: Files ending with `_merged` are excluded automatically from the processing.
